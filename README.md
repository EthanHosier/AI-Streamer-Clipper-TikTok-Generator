# AI Streamer Clipper / TikTok Generator
This repo contains the code from two seperate projects, which I merged. The first project is an "AI Streamer Clipper" which is able to watch any stream (twitch, kick, youtube, tiktok etc...) in real-time and
automatically find and clip moments which are likely to go viral. The idea was to offer a subscription service which allowed "clippers" to subscribe to multiple streamers at once and get sent their clips (which they
could then repost on TikTok), but I realised this was illegal as it was serving copywrited content.

The second part of this repo is a TikTok clip generator, which is able to auto-caption and edit videos in a variety of styles seen commonly on TikTok
